If you've recently set up your Minecraft server and are wondering how to log in, don't worry - we've got you covered! Just follow these simple steps:

1. **Obtain the IP address:** To log in to your Minecraft server, you need to obtain the IP address. The IP address is a unique identifier that allows your Minecraft game to connect to the server. It is provided to you when you set up your server and can usually be found in the dashboard settings. Here's how you can locate the IP address:

   - Access the dashboard of your Minecraft server. This is typically a web-based control panel that allows you to manage your server.
   - Look for the IP address information in the dashboard. It is often displayed prominently, such as at the top right of the console page for your server.

2. **Launch Minecraft:** Once you have the IP address, open the Minecraft game on your device. Make sure you have the correct version of Minecraft installed to ensure compatibility with the server.

   - Locate the Minecraft application on your device and launch it.

3. **Go to the "Multiplayer" menu:** From the main menu, click on the "Multiplayer" option.

4. **Add the server:** In the multiplayer menu, click on the "Add Server" button.

5. **Enter server details:** In the server information fields, give your server a name and enter the IP address you obtained from the dashboard settings.

6. **Save the server:** Click the "Done" button to save the server information.

7. **Join the server:** From the multiplayer menu, select the server you just added.

8. **Log in and play:** Finally, click on the "Join Server" button to log in and start playing on your Minecraft server.

Please note that it may take a few moments for the server to appear in the server list after you add it.
