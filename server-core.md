## How to change server cores?

To change server cores, follow these steps:

1. **Download the jar or files for the server:** Locate and download the desired server core or files that you want to use.

2. **Upload the files to the server:** Access your server files and upload the downloaded jar or files to the appropriate location.

3. **Modify the startup command:** Find the startup command for your server, which should contain the parameter for the server jar file. It may look like this: `"SERVER JAR FILE"`. Replace `"SERVER JAR FILE"` with the name of the newly uploaded jar file.

   For example, if the new jar file is named `arclight-forge-1.16.5-1.0.24.jar`, modify the startup command to `"arclight-forge-1.16.5-1.0.24.jar"`.

4. **Restart the server:** Save the changes and restart the server. The server will now use the new jar file as the server core.

By following these steps, you can easily change the server core of your Minecraft server. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to reach out to our support team for assistance.
