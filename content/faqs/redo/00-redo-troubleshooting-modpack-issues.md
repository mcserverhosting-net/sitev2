Experiencing issues with your modpack can be frustrating. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve modpack problems:

1. **Check Modpack Compatibility**: Make sure the modpack version is compatible with your server's Minecraft version.
2. **Review Memory Requirements**: Some modpacks demand more memory. If performance issues arise, consider allocating more RAM to the Minecraft client or upgrading your server plan.
3. **Modpack Installation**: Use SFTP to upload your modpack files to the server. If you encounter difficulties, refer to guides like [Using SFTP with WinSCP](https://mcserverhosting.net/faqs/how-to-access-files-using-winscp/).
4. **Server Upgrade Considerations**: If the modpack is resource-intensive, upgrading your server plan may be necessary. Check available plans that suit the modpack's requirements and consult support to make the update.
5. **Contact Support**: If issues persist after trying the above steps, reach out to the support team with details of the issue and any error messages encountered.

Remember to perform regular backups of your server data to avoid losing progress during troubleshooting and upgrades.
