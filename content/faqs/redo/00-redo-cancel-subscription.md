To cancel your subscription for a Minecraft server:

1. Contact support with a message indicating your desire to cancel your subscription.
2. Provide the email associated with your account to help our support team quickly locate your subscription details.
3. Await confirmation from the support team; they will process your request and send a notification once your subscription has been cancelled.

Please note the cancellation process may take some time to be completed. If you don't receive a confirmation email within a reasonable period, feel free to follow up with the support team.

Thank you for choosing us, and if there's anything we could have done better, we would love to hear your feedback.
