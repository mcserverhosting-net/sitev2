Choosing the right hardware is crucial when setting up a Minecraft server. This FAQ will guide you through the hardware requirements essential for running a smooth and stable server.

## Why are Hardware Requirements Important?

The hardware you choose will directly impact your server's performance. It determines how many players can join without experiencing lag, the type of server you can run, and the overall player experience.

## Basic Hardware Specifications

- **Processor (CPU)**: The heart of your server. A multi-core processor with high clock speed is recommended for the best performance.
- **Memory (RAM)**: Minecraft servers are memory intensive. The amount of RAM required depends on the type of server and the player count.
- **Storage**: Solid State Drives (SSDs) are preferred for quicker data access and better server responsiveness.
- **Network**: A fast and stable internet connection with a good upload speed is essential for hosting players without lag.

## Recommended Hardware per Server Type

### Vanilla and Bukkit/Spigot

- Basic server for up to 10 players: At least 2GB of RAM
- Medium server for up to 25 players: 4GB to 6GB of RAM

### Forge and Modpacks

- 4GB of RAM minimum due to the increased resource demand from mods. More players and mods will require additional RAM.

### Bedrock Edition

- Typically requires less RAM than Java Edition servers. 2GB to 4GB of RAM can suffice for most scenarios.

## Final Thoughts

Invest in the best hardware you can within your budget, as it will pay off in server performance. Stay tuned for our next FAQ, where we will discuss the installation process for different server types.
