To set up your server with Forge:

1. Determine the version of Minecraft for which you want to install Forge (e.g., 1.16.5).
2. Access the server panel and navigate to the server settings.
3. In the server settings, find the option to change the server's Minecraft version and select the Forge version corresponding to your desired Minecraft version.
4. Save the changes and restart your server.
5. Once restarted, your server should be running the specified Forge version.

Please be patient as changes can take a few minutes to take effect. If you experience any issues, don't hesitate to reach out for support.
