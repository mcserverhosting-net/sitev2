5. To start or stop the Minecraft server, click on the "Start" or "Stop" button located on the dashboard panel.

## Uploading files

To connect to SFTP and work on or upload/download files, go to the server you want to edit, then access the Settings. Under "SFTP Details" you will find your connection information, which can also be found [here](https://mcserverhosting.net/faqs/how-to-access-files-using-winscp/).
