If you're encountering modpack compatibility issues or considering an upgrade to your server plan, here's what you need to know:

### Modpack Compatibility Issues:
- Ensure you have the right version of the modpack that corresponds with your server's Minecraft version.
- Check the modpack's memory requirements; certain modpacks demand more resources and may not function well on lower-tier plans.
- If you encounter errors regarding out of memory or crashes, consider allocating more RAM to your Minecraft client and/or upgrading your server plan.
- For persistent issues, consult with the modpack's creators or community forums for specific guidance.

Regularly back up your server data to prevent loss during unexpected downtimes or when changing server settings.
