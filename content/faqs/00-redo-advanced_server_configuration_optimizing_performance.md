Users do not have the ability to invest in hardware changes They can only increase their plan. We have a list of plans at https://mcserverhosting.net/plans-premade/ 


The server admin should also take account for client side issues when they get a report from the player that they are lagging. There should be a separate guide for optimizing minecraft client performance. 

Users can adjsut their java args in the Startup tab of their server UI panel. 

Encourage the use of spark profiler https://spark.lucko.me/ that can run on many modded servers. Link to their documentation for further guidance for the user, but provide a brief summary and outline of commands they can run to generate a report for themselves here based on the doc.

Performance optimization is essential for providing the best experience on your Minecraft server. This FAQ will address strategies to enhance server performance, reduce lag, and ensure smooth gameplay for all players.

## Understanding Server Performance

- **Tick Rate**: The server's heart, controlling the frequency of updates to the game world.
- **Memory Allocation**: Assigning sufficient memory is key to performance, but too much can lead to waste.
- **Garbage Collection**: Proper configuration can reduce stutter and lag during gameplay.

## Performance Optimization Strategies

- **Hardware Upgrades**: Investing in faster CPUs and SSD storage can have a significant impact.
- **Software Tweaks**: Adjustments to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) arguments and careful plugin/mod selection can optimize server operations.
- **Timings Reports**: Use Spigot's built-in timings tool to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## Advanced Tools and Practices

- **Pre-generating Worlds**: Reducing the load on your server during peak times by pre-generating chunks.
- **View Distance Reduction**: Adjusting the view distance down can enhance performance without greatly affecting gameplay.
- **Use of Performance Plugins**: Plugins like Paper, which is a fork of Spigot optimized for performance, can benefit your server's responsiveness.

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly improve your Minecraft server's performance. Always remember to test each change extensively to find the perfect balance for your specific setup. Look forward to our next FAQ, where we'll discuss automating server management tasks.
