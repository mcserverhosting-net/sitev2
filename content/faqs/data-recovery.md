If you encounter technical issues with your server such as storage failures or it being stuck on startup, your data's safety and recovery are top priorities. Here's what you can typically expect:

1. Contact support indicating the problem and provide your server details, including any error messages and the server ID if available.
2. Our team will investigate the cause and work on a resolution, keeping you informed throughout the process.
3. In cases of hardware failure, we endeavor to recover and transfer your data to a new server or provide temporary solutions while recovery is in progress.
4. Regular backups are recommended. Inquire about backup options and procedures to safeguard your data against unexpected issues.
5. If data recovery takes an extended amount of time or is not possible, you may be entitled to compensation, like service refunds or credits.
6. Once the issue is resolved or your data is recovered, support will guide you through any necessary steps to restore service.

We understand the importance of your data and make every effort to ensure its integrity and availability, even in challenging technical circumstances.
