## How to Locate Logs/Crash Reports

### For Minecraft Client:

1. Open the Windows start menu and type in "%appdata%" and press Enter.
2. Open the `.minecraft` folder.
3. Open either the `logs` or `crash-reports` folder.
   - Crash reports are files that get logged when Minecraft crashes.
4. Open the `latest.log` for the latest log and open the crash text file with the latest date and time on it.


### For Minecraft Server:

1. Open the files tab.
2. Open `crash-reports` folder.
3. Find the one for the correct time.
4. Open and read what happened.
