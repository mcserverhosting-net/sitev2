To add mods to your Minecraft server:

1. Decide on the mods or modpack you'd like to install.
2. Identify the version of Minecraft for which the mods are made.
3. If your server isn't already set up for mods, request support to set up Forge or an appropriate mod loader for your Minecraft version.
4. Use the file management interface through your server's control panel or connect via SFTP to upload the mods to your server. For SFTP, you can follow our guide on [how to access files using WinSCP](https://mcserverhosting.net/faqs/how-to-access-files-using-winscp/).
5. Once the mods are uploaded, restart your server to apply the changes.
