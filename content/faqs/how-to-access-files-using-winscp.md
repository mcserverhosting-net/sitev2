   **Option 1:**

   1. From the WinSCP home screen, select **New Site**.
   2. On the right panel, under **Host name**, type in the server address.
   3. For the **port number**, type in port 2022.
   4. For the **username**, type in your username that you see in settings on the dashboard.
   5. For the **password**, use the password for the dashboard.
   6. Hit **Save** and give the site a name like "My MCSH Namespace", then click **OK**.
   7. Click **Login**.

   **Option 2:**

   1. Click the **Launch SFTP** button under **SFTP Details**.
   2. You'll be directed to the server's `minecraft` folder on the right side, while your local files will be displayed on the left.
