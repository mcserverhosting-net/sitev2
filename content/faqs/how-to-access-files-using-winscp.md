WinSCP works to give access to your files securely using your password.

1. Go to the dashboard
2. Go to settings and then follow either way below:

One way:

1. From the home screen, select **New Site**
2. On the right panel, under **Host name**: type in the server address.
3. For the **port number**, type in port 22
4. For the **username**, type in your username that you used to login to the dashboard
5. for the **password** use the password for the dashboard.
6. Hit **Save**, and give the site a name like "My MCSH Namespace", then OK again
7. Hit **Login**.

Second way to view (your still need winscp): 
click the 'launch SFTP' button under SFTP details.

You’ll see your server’s `minecraft` folder on the right, and your files on the left.
