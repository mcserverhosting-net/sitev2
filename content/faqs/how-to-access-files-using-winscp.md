## Accessing Your Minecraft Server Files with WinSCP

To securely manage your server files, WinSCP is an excellent choice. Here's how to start:

- Go to your dashboard and select 'Settings'.
- Under 'SFTP Details', click 'Launch SFTP'.

Alternatively, set up a new site in WinSCP directly:

- Open WinSCP and select 'New Site'.
- Use the server address as the host name.
- Enter '2022' for the port number.
- Your dashboard username is your WinSCP username.
- The dashboard password is also your WinSCP password.
- Save the settings with a name like "My MCSH server" and connect by clicking 'Login'.
