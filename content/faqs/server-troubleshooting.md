If your server is stuck on startup, follow these steps:

1. Reach out to support with your server details, including the name and the email associated with your account.
2. Patiently await an update from customer support as they might be resolving a broad range of issues impacting your server's performance.
3. If informed about data complications, ask about potential compensation and actions being taken for data recovery.
4. Remain in close communication with the support team, who will guide you through any necessary steps.
5. If provided with temporary solutions, such as a temporary server, verify the functionality and inquire about transferring data back to the main server once a resolution is found.

Our support team works diligently to resolve issues, and your understanding and communication are highly appreciated when there are delays due to technical troubles.
