      receive their own public IPv4 address.  Bungee servers live on our edge
      routers for ultra-fast latency.  VPS servers receive their own public
      IPv4 address. Note: VPS servers begin with Debian 10 running the 
      Cockpit Dashboard. Please reach out to us if you would like an alternative OS.
