Our staff is committed to helping you enhance your server experience by adding new features. If you have specific feature requests or want to add new server cores, please follow these steps:

1. **Join our Discord server:** Join our Discord community to connect with our staff and other server owners. It's a great platform for sharing ideas, discussing server-related topics, and seeking assistance.

2. **Create a support ticket:** Once you're in our Discord server, create a support ticket to request the addition of new features or server cores. In the ticket, provide details about the features you would like to add and any specific requirements or preferences you may have.

Our dedicated staff members will carefully review your request and respond to it as soon as possible. While we cannot guarantee that all feature requests will be implemented, we highly value your input and continuously strive to improve our services based on user feedback.

Feel free to reach out to our staff through the support ticket system in our Discord server. We are here to listen to your needs and assist you in expanding and customizing your server to meet your requirements.

We appreciate your interest in adding new features to your server and look forward to working with you to enhance your Minecraft experience.
