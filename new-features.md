If you have any requests for new features to be added to your server, we encourage you to follow these steps:

1. **Join our Discord server:** Become part of our lively Discord community, where you can connect with our staff and other server owners. This is the perfect platform to share ideas, engage in discussions about server-related topics, and seek assistance from our knowledgeable team.

2. **Create a support ticket:** Once you've joined our Discord server, create a support ticket to outline your feature requests. Please provide us with detailed information about the feature you would like to add, including any specific requirements or preferences you may have. 

Notes: that we do not manage mods for customers. If you are looking to modify your server's core, please refer to our page on server cores at [Server Core](https://mcserverhosting.net/faqs/server-core).
